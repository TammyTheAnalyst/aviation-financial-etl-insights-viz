## ✈️ Aviation Financial Data Visual Analysis  

📊 **Report 1: Airline Operating Expenses by Year** 

- This visual highlights the **total operating expenses for each airline** within the dataset.
**Delta Air Lines** reported the highest expenses, followed by **Federal Express Corporation**, **American Airlines**, and **United Airlines**. **Southwest Airlines** and **JetBlue Airways** recorded comparatively lower operating costs. This high-level overview provides a quick snapshot of operational cost distribution across major U.S. carriers.

📊 **Report 2: Top 5 Airlines by Quarter** 

- This clustered column chart focuses on the **top five airlines by total operating expenses**, breaking down their costs by financial quarter.
**Delta Air Lines** consistently maintained the highest expenses in Q1 and Q2. In Q3, **Federal Express Corporation’s** operating expenses surged ahead — likely reflecting increased demand for cargo and logistics services during the holiday season. **Southwest Airlines** consistently reported the lowest operating expenses across all quarters analyzed.

📊 **Report 3: Quarterly Operating Expenses Trend for Top 5 Airlines**  

- This visual tracks quarterly operating expenses for the top five U.S. airlines. Delta Air Lines consistently led expenses in the first half of the year, while Federal Express surged ahead in Q3 — likely reflecting increased logistics demand. Southwest Airlines maintained the lowest operating costs throughout the year.

### 📝 Summary 

- This analysis was designed to practice essential **ETL process management, SQL querying, Python scripting, data validation, and Power BI reporting** skills using aviation financial data.  

- While the aviation and aerospace sector has always been a personal high-interest area for me, from passenger jets to military demonstration teams and small training aircraft,
this project is equally intended to demonstrate transferable skills that apply across multiple industries.

---


## Data Source

- This project uses publicly available U.S. airline financial data provided by the **Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)** through their TranStats platform.  
The specific dataset used is:

- **Dataset:**
   
**T-100 Segment (Schedule P-6) — U.S. Carrier Operating Expense Data**

---


## Why This Data Matters

- This data is crucial in the aviation industry for tracking carrier financial performance, analyzing trends in operating costs, and benchmarking expenses across different airlines.  

- In this project, it’s used to demonstrate an **ETL pipeline and data analytics workflow**, moving raw financial data through **Python, SQL, and Power BI** for reporting and insight generation.
