## ✈️ Aviation Financial Data Visual Analysis  

📊 **Report 1: Airline Operating Expenses by Year** 

- This visual highlights the **total operating expenses for each airline** within the dataset.
**Delta Air Lines** reported the highest expenses, followed by **Federal Express Corporation**, **American Airlines**, and **United Airlines**. **Southwest Airlines** and **JetBlue Airways** recorded comparatively lower operating costs. This high-level overview provides a quick snapshot of operational cost distribution across major U.S. carriers.

📈 **Report 2: Top 5 Airlines by Quarter** 

- This clustered column chart focuses on the **top five airlines by total operating expenses**, breaking down their costs by financial quarter.
**Delta Air Lines** consistently maintained the highest expenses in Q1 and Q2. In Q3, **Federal Express Corporation’s** operating expenses surged ahead — likely reflecting increased demand for cargo and logistics services during the holiday season. **Southwest Airlines** consistently reported the lowest operating expenses across all quarters analyzed.

### 📝 Summary 

- This analysis was designed to practice essential **ETL process management, SQL querying, Python scripting, data validation, and Power BI reporting** skills using aviation financial data.  

- While the aviation and aerospace sector has always been a personal high-interest area for me, from passenger jets to military demonstration teams and small training aircraft,
this project is equally intended to demonstrate transferable skills that apply across multiple industries.

---


## Data Source

- This project uses publicly available U.S. airline financial data provided by the **Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)** through their TranStats platform.  
The specific dataset used is:

- **Dataset:**
   
**T-100 Segment (Schedule P-6) — U.S. Carrier Operating Expense Data**

---


## Why This Data Matters

- This data is crucial in the aviation industry for tracking carrier financial performance, analyzing trends in operating costs, and benchmarking expenses across different airlines.  

- In this project, it’s used to demonstrate an **ETL pipeline and data analytics workflow**, moving raw financial data through **Python, SQL, and Power BI** for reporting and insight generation.
