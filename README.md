# Aviation & Financial ETL, Insights & Visualization Project ✈️📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data workflow involving:
- Extracting aviation and financial data
- Transforming and cleaning the data using Python
- Loading the clean data for analysis
- Generating actionable insights
- Creating visualizations using Power BI (or Matplotlib)
- Managing workflow via GitHub Projects for clear task tracking
