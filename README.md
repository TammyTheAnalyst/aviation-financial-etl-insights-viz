### 📝 Summary 

This analysis was designed to practice essential **ETL process management, SQL querying, Python scripting, data validation, and Power BI reporting** skills using aviation financial data.  

While the aviation and aerospace sector has always been a personal high-interest area for me, from passenger jets to military demonstration teams and small training aircraft,
this project is equally intended to demonstrate transferable skills that apply across multiple industries.

## Data Source

This project uses publicly available U.S. airline financial data provided by the **Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)** through their TranStats platform.  
The specific dataset used is:

**Dataset:**  
**T-100 Segment (Schedule P-6) — U.S. Carrier Operating Expense Data**

---


## Why This Data Matters

This data is crucial in the aviation industry for tracking carrier financial performance, analyzing trends in operating costs, and benchmarking expenses across different airlines.  

In this project, it’s used to demonstrate an **ETL pipeline and data analytics workflow**, moving raw financial data through **Python, SQL, and Power BI** for reporting and insight generation.
